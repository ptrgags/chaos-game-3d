## Chaos Game 3D 

## 2019, 2020 Initial Version

This project aims to take concepts from Chaos Game fractals (from 
_Fractals Everywhere_ by Michael F. Barnsley, used in programs such as
Apophysis) and extend it to 3D using point clouds.

Originally I started with basic affine transformations (translation, rotation, 
scale). But after learning about geometric algebra, I realized I could take
it further and express reflections and even sphere inversions. Furthermore,
I realized I could take concepts from _Indra's Pearls_ by Mumford, Series and 
Wright and extend them to 3D (to some extent, the formulas are not as elegant as
MÃ¶bius transformations in the complex plane. And this leads to some interesting
shapes.

The output of the program so far has been
[3D Tiles](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/main/specification),
an open standard for streaming massive 3D datasets. Usually it's used for
geospatial applications, but I find it useful because it represents octrees
and point clouds easily. I used the `.pnts` format for encoding point clouds
and overall the tileset is structured like an octree.

## 2021-12-29 Future Direction

Looking back at this after almost a year, I realize there's a lot of things
I could have done better. When I first made this application, I was still 
new at Cesium and hadn't used CesiumJS much. Since then I've gotten much more
familiar with 3D Tiles, so I realize there's some easy tweaks I could use to
make this better.

Additionally, I have some new ideas given the recent developments
of [3D Tiles Next](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/main/next)

>**Disclaimer** I'm a developer on the 3D Tiles team, so I've worked on
these extensions and some other CesiumJS features such as Custom Shaders.

* In the viewer application, I scale the tileset up to be the size of the world.
    I realize now that ENU matrices are easy to compute with CesiumJS' API,
    so I could use that and position fractals somewhere in the world.
* The future of 3D Tiles is glTF, so it would be better to write a `glTF` with
    `POINTS` primitives instead of `pnts` files
* I could make use of some 3D Tiles Next extensions:
  * `3DTILES_implicit_tiling` -- these tilesets are always octrees, so implicit
    tiling is a natural choice
  * `3DTILES_metadata` -- I could use this to encode some information about
    the fractal in tileset metadata. Maybe even tile metadata.
  * `EXT_mesh_features` -- with this glTF extension, I could encode metadata
    about individual points. More on this point below
* CesiumJS now has a [Custom Shaders](https://sandcastle.cesium.com/?src=Custom%20Shaders%20Models.html&label=3D%20Tiles%20Next) feature, I could
    use this to make more interesting styles and animations
* I've learned about JSON Schema, so I could make schema files for the
  parameters to help document and validate things
* I don't like that all the rendering settings are in the
    same file as the fractal parameters. For example, I might want to change
    the number of iterations for a smaller, quicker render. Consider separating
    the fractal parameters from the rendering parameters.
* I should make a gallery of cool examples and make a `gh-pages` branch. I
    don't want to take up too much storage so maybe just 2-3 of the best
    examples
* I recently learned about a different flavor of geometric algebra,
    Conformal Geometric Algebra. This might be a better representation since
    even translations and inversions can be represented directly
* I need a better mechanism to maintain the viewer folder. It would be nice
    to have a script that can put together a JSON file with all the tilesets

Some ideas for metadata:

* Iteration count - Could be used for styling, or even animating the points.
* Transformation IDs. This could be the most recent transformation (or the 
    first?) or even an array of the latest N transformations. Coloring by this
    could be useful
* Color Transformation IDs. (similar to the previous point)

## 2022-01-02 Refactoring 3D Tiles Output

Today I started working on the 3D Tiles Next output, but I soon realized that
this requires refactoring things a bit. I pulled out a `TilesetWriter` struct
(since I will likely have variations on this in the future for implicit tiling)
and I stubbed out a `GlbWriter` class to parallel the older `PntsWriter`. I
will likely keep both around for a while since the 3D Tiles Next extensions
are still experimental and may change.

## 2022-01-09 Continue working on GLB output

Today I continued to work on GLB output. Along the way, I noticed I was passing
a lot of variables for each point, so I refactored out a `Point` class to store
the position, color, and metadata for each point. Overall, it works nicely,
though there are some parts where I end up copying data a lot. I'll have to
revisit this again in the future.

At this point I can compile things, but it's not yet producing valid glTF files.

## 2022-01-10 Debug GLB output

Today I started working on debugging my GLB output. I had quite a few incorrect
offsets/byte lengths to fix.

I'm still having trouble loading the results in CesiumJS. The latest error
seems to have something to do with the resource cache not being able to find
the buffer. I'll keep digging around

## 2022-01-11 glTF Validator to the Rescue

This morning I tried running the GLB output through the official
[glTF validator](https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Validator/), which revealed
some issues with alignment. I also forgot that vertex attributes need to be
aligned to 4-byte offsets. Now I'm able to load things in CesiumJS!

## 2022-01-12 Decimation

Today I implemented basic decimation to create levels of detail. I simply
take 1/4th of the points in each child tile and add them to the parent. This
is done just before the tileset is saved to disk.

Something seems a little weird with the bounding volumes, the largest ones
don't seem to be showing up. I should check the bounding volumes and recursive
logic.

## 2022-01-13 Fix y-up issue

Today I merged in `main` to pull in the decimation features. I then added
the z-up to y-up transform in the root node of each GLB so it renders properly
in CesiumJS.

I also reviewed [the PR](https://github.com/ptrgags/chaos-game-3d/pull/7) to
point out several things I think could be better and use more of 3D Tiles Next.
I think adding the `3DTILES_metadata` extension will be helpful here.

## 2022-01-16 Add tileset metadata, update parameters

The past couple days I wrapped up the 3D Tiles Next stuff and updated most of
the parameter files to include an id and name. There's a few I didn't get to,
but I'll handle those later when I go to make a script to index the files.

## 2022-01-24 Automatically populate the UI

This morning I added a script, `viewer/make_index.py` that looks through the
tileset directories and puts together an index file, `fractals.json`. This
is now used by the viewer to populate the dropdown. This way, I don't have
to edit `index.html` every time I add a new fractal.
